        <p>This project is a 2-year project at the Department of 
        Sociology in the CUHK to evaluate to better understand what 
        is driving emigration from Hong Kong and also what ties Hong Kong 
        residents to Hong Kong society.  We aim to generate policy-oriented analysis 
        that can help to the management of emigration flows and the impact that they 
        have had on different social and economic sectors of Hong Kong society. </p>
        <h3>Towards a better system</h3>
        <p>We will conduct workshops disseminating our findings to government officials, 
            civil society organizations in Hong Kong and other parts of Asia, professional associations, 
            and other groups greatly affected by the out-migration of people from Hong Kong.</p>
        <h3>Advocacy and Education</h3>
        <p>We will also publicize our findings through research briefs, scholarly articles and the media, 
            and integrate them into future advocacy and educational activities.  </p>
